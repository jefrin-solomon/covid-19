A pygame

         This is my first game in python. In fact this is my first game in any language.....
         
         I am hereby writing this only to thank NEC college 'nerds'. 
         They had done a great job and made these quarantine days useful
         
         And I also wanna thank guvi-an online tutoring firm who taught pygame for free
         
         Hope you enjoy and like this game......
